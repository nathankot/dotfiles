The icons included are an open source set of icons (original work available here:  http://design.rolanberry.org/).  To install in adium, replace the existing files in the following folder with the new files:

Adium.app/Contents/Resources/Status Icons/Gems.AdiumStatusIcons/

If you only want the tab icons replaced and not the status icons in the buddy list, only drag the icons that start "tab-".  

As soon as the status icon packs are available, I will turn this into one.  For now you'll have to copy over the icons every time you update Adium.

Update - For those running .8 SVN, you can simply copy the folder into your ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Status Icons/ folder.
